I need to consider the following neural network architectures:<br />
ResNet_20 with short cut with weight decay and BS=128 <br />
ResNet_20 without short cut with weight decay and BS=128 <br />
ResNet_20 with short cut with without weight decay and BS=128 <br />
ResNet_20 without short cut without weight decay and BS=128 <br />
ResNet_20 with short cut  without weight decay and BS=8192 <br />
ResNet_20 without short cut without weight decay and BS=8192 <br />
ResNet_20 with short cut with with weight decay and BS=8192 <br />
ResNet_20 without short cut with weight decay and BS=8192 <br />
<br />
ResNet_56 with shortcut with weight decay and BS=128 <br />
ResNet_56 with shortcut without weight decay and BS=128 <br />
ResNet_56 without shortcut with weight decay and BS=128 <br />
ResNet_56 without shortcut without weight decay and BS=128 <br />
<br />
ResNet_56 with shortcut with weight decay and BS=8192 <br />
ResNet_56 with shortcut without weight decay and BS=8192 <br />
ResNet_56 without shortcut with weight decay and BS=8192 <br />
ResNet_56 without shortcut without weight decay and BS=8192 <br />
<br />
the same for ResNet_56 but with multiplying the number of filters k=2,k=4 <br />
ResNet_56 with shortcut with weight decay and BS=128 <br />
ResNet_56 with shortcut without weight decay and BS=128 <br />
ResNet_56 without shortcut with weight decay and BS= 128 <br />
ResNet_56 without shortcut without weight decay and BS=128 <br />
<br />
ResNet_56 with shortcut with weight decay and BS=8192 <br />
ResNet_56 with shortcut without weight decay and BS=8192 <br />
ResNet_56 without shortcut with weight decay and BS=8192 <br />
ResNet_56 without shortcut without weight decay and BS=8192 <br />

<br />
<br />

the article shows results for the network Resnet_110 and Resnet_56 with multiplying the number of filters k=8
But i am not sure if I can repeat the calculations, because of capacity.

By 19 Nov, was written all neural network architectures and performed calculations for ResNet_20 with shortcut. you can see in in pdf files.
